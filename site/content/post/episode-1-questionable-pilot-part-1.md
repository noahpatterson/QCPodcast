Teh first episode of our new podcast about Jeph Jacques' webcomic Questionable Content. Hosts Jess and Kate have been reading this comic together for almost as long as they have known each other. For the podcast they are starting from the beginning and talking about the characters, the relationships, the art, and how they have related to all of it over the past decade.

Episode 1 came out really long (we are new at this) so it is split into two parts. Roughly, Part 1 covers comics 1 - 41, and Part 2 covers comics 42 - 100. Episode 2 will be waaaay shorter, we promise.
